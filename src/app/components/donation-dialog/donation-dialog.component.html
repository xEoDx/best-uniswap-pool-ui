  <h3><b>How does it work?</b></h3>
  <p>Every 12h we compute all transactions done in the last 5 days on the Ethereum and Polygon networks, to be able to determine which is the best pool to provide liquidity. You can use this information to move your funds from existing pools or to create new positions based on the score parameter.</p>

  <h3><b>Avg. gain / dollar provided</b></h3>
  <p>This value is calculated based on the volume, tvl and the fee of the pool. This is based on the last 5 days, but it provides useful data on which are the pools that will give more commissions.</p>

  <h3><b>Server cost</b></h3>
  <p>Hosting this application has a cost. Any donation will help to mitigate the costs of maintaining the setup alive.</p>
